These codes are intended for the analysis of in vitro motility assays.  
Run the codes ending in numbers sequentially. The rest are functions called within these codes and do not need to be executed separately.  
To begin you need a csv file containing the particle localizations and tracks (generated with DoM Utrecht) and a csv file containing the MT x,y coordinates of the corresponding movie (generated using the Hadim template script ROI_XY_Saver).  
If you intend to proceed from code _1 to _2 ensure you toggle zsave in _1 to 1.  
Other instructions are given at the top of each code.
